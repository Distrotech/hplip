The SystemServices object is used to encapsulate memory-management, I/O,
clock access, user notification and UI, and other utilities provided by the
operating system or host system supporting the driver. It is an abstract base
class, requiring implementation of the necessary routines by the host.
Creation of SystemServices is the first step in the calling sequence for the
driver, followed by creation of the PrintContext and the Job. The derived
class constructor must include a call to the member function InitDeviceComm,
which establishes communication with the printer if possible.
The only reference to this object in API-calling code should be to its
constructor and destructor, which must be invoked prior to and after all other
driver calls.

    //! Passes a command to the I/O system to send all data to the printer immediately.
    /*!
    A typical I/O system either buffer data or send data immediatly.  If the I/O
    system is buffering data then typically store all data sent in a buffer until it
    has some amount of data (say 1, 2, or 4 Kbytes) then will send that block of data
    to the printer. In some cases, it may be necessary that data that has just been
    sent to the I/O system reach the printer ASAP, at which point the printer driver
    will check the status or deviceID string of the printer and continue. Often,
    USB implementations will favor the block-send mechanism because it is more
    efficient through the system's call stack. Simple and traditional centronics
    I/O is usually not buffered, but this is still a system-by-system I/O preference.

    If the I/O system is buffering data into blocks before sending to the printer,
    this command should pass a command to the I/O system to stop waiting and send
    everything it has to the printer now. The base implimentation simply returns
    NO_ERROR and is appropriate for a system that does not buffer I/O.

    \note  The appropriate way to handle a FlushIO on a buffered system is to call
    the USB class driver's I/O Control routine with a flush command.  If the USB
    class driver has no flush command then check to see if it has timed flush
    (it auto-flushes every n [milli]seconds).  If it does then the base FlushIO
    method will work okay.

    \warning In the past some have implemented flush by sending 10K nulls to the USB
    driver.  Currently this does work and will cause data already in the buffer
    to be sent to the printer.  Current printers ignore the null, however, there
    may be printers in the future that cannot handle this behavior.

    /*!
    This routine instructs the I/O system that this print job has ended
    prematurely, that no further data will be sent and that any data being held
    in a "send" buffer can be thrown away. This command is optional and depends
    on the implementation of the I/O system.  In some error conditions, the
    printer is incapable of accepting more data. The printer driver will sense
    this error and stop sending data, but if the I/O system has buffered data
    it may continue to wait for the printer to accept this remaining data
    before unloading. This mechanism will allow for a more efficient clean up
    of the aborted job.

    to dialogs or pop-ups.  The BusyWait method should return NO_ERROR if we should
    continue processing.  The APDK core code calls busy wait within loops (when
    the printer is out of paper, has no pen, etc...) and will continue when the
    user has fixed the problem.  If the user wants to cancel the job then the
    implemented version of BusyWait must return JOB_CANCELED so that the APDK
